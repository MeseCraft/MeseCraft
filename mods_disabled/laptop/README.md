# Laptop | Computers emulation for Minetest

The Laptop mod is a group collaboration between bell07, Cross_over, Gerold55, Toby109tt, v-rob, veNext, Grizzly Adam  and Yours truly lol.
We aim to make a working laptop inside of MineTest.
There are different computers, apps which run on computers, media to store data and different themes to personalize the appearance.
