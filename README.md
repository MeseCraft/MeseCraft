Development Cycle

There are three main git branches of MeseCraft:
* `master`: stable branch, meant to be ran by players and on servers. Focused on high stability.
* `testing`: beta branch, for testing new updates, finding bugs, and eliminating them before merging into the main branch.
* `unstable`: alpha branch, a staging branch for additions to MeseCraft. For new code, updates, and fixes. Changes and commits should go here.
