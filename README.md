Development Cycle
-------------------------
There are three main git branches of MeseCraft:
* `main`: stable branch, meant to be ran by players and on servers. Focused on high stability.
* `testing`: beta branch, for testing new updates, finding bugs, and eliminating them before merging into the main branch.
* `unstable`: alpha branch, a staging branch for additions to MeseCraft. For new code, updates, and fixes. Changes and commits should go here.

Minetest Engine Requirements
--------------------------
Minetest engine version 5.2.0 or greater is currently recommended to run this game.
Minetest engine version 5.1.1 is compatabile but not all mods and function completely.
