## Description
Add some childish fun to the game by making the default beds bouncy! Yes it does exactly what it says on the tin! Enjoy reckless bounces by abusing your in-game mattresses and getting some airtime.

## How does it work?
The mod essentially just appends the bouncy and fall damage groups onto the default beds in the game and adds a cute bouncing sound! This creative mod was a suggestion from a player, kiopy7, in the server, Sara's Simple Survival Server. Thank you!
