## Installation

### Download the mod

To install Gauges, clone this Git repository into your Minetest's `mods/`
directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/minetest-mods/gauges.git
```

You can also
[download a ZIP archive](https://github.com/minetest-mods/gauges/archive/master.zip)
of Gauges.

### Enable the mod

Once you have installed Gauges, you need to enable it in Minetest.
The procedure is as follows:

#### Using the client's main menu

This is the easiest way to enable Gauges when playing in singleplayer
(or on a server hosted from a client).

1. Start Minetest and switch to the **Local Game** tab.
2. Select the world you want to enable Gauges in.
3. Click **Configure**, then enable `gauges` by double-clicking it
   (or ticking the **Enabled** checkbox).
4. Save the changes, then start a game on the world you enabled Gauges on.
5. Gauges should now be running on your world.

#### Using a text editor

This is the recommended way to enable the mod on a server without using a GUI.

1. Make sure Minetest is not currently running (otherwise, it will overwrite
   the changes when exiting).
2. Open the world's `world.mt` file using a text editor.
3. Add the following line at the end of the file:

```text
load_mod_gauges = true
```

If the line is already present in the file, then replace `false` with `true`
on that line.

4. Save the file, then start a game on the world you enabled Gauges on.
5. Gauges should now be running on your world.

## Version compatibility

Gauges is currently primarily tested with Minetest 5.1.0 and 0.4.17. It may or may not work
with newer or older versions. Issues arising in versions older than 5.0.0
will generally not be fixed.
