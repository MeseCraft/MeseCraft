Farming API
-----------

The farming API allows you to easily register plants and hoes.

`farming.register_hoe(name, hoe definition)`
 * Register a new hoe, see [#hoe definition]

`farming.register_plant(name, Plant definition)`
 * Register a new growing plant, see [#Plant definition]

`farming.registered_plants[name] = definition`
 * Table of registered plants, indexed by plant name
    'crop' holds name of growing crop node minus _step-number at end
    'seed' has name of seed required to plant crop
    'minlight' min light level needed to grow
    'maxlight' max light level needed to grow
    'steps' number of steps crop has in growth cycle

### Hoe Definition


	{
		description = "My Hoe",                -- Description for tooltip
		inventory_image = "unknown_item.png",  -- Image to be used as wield- and inventory image
		max_uses = 30,                         -- Uses until destroyed
		material = "",                         -- Material for recipes
		recipe = {                             -- Craft recipe, if material isn't used
			{"air", "air", "air"},
			{"", "group:stick"},
			{"", "group:stick"},
		}
	}

### Plant definition

	{
		description = "My Plant",              -- Description of seed item
		inventory_image = "unknown_item.png",  -- Image to be used as seed's wield- and inventory image
		steps = 8,                             -- How many steps the plant has to grow, until it can be harvested
		-- ^ Always provide a plant texture for each step, format: modname_plantname_i.png (i = stepnumber)
		minlight = 13,                         -- Minimum light to grow
		maxlight = default.LIGHT_MAX           -- Maximum light to grow
	}

Note: Any crops registered with the above function will use the new growing routines, also if crops are manually added with the {growing=1} group they will also grow.

### Crop functions

If a mod registers nodes to be used as crops using the {growing=1} group then an additional function can be used for custom growth checks instead of the standard 'are we above wet soil'.

growth_check = function(pos, node_name)
	-- check surrounding for jungle tree
	if minetest.find_node_near(pos, 1, {"default:jungletree"}) then
		return false -- place next growth stage
	end
	return true -- condition not met, skip next growth stage until next check
end,

### Scythe items that will not drop

This is a function to add items to a list that scythes will not drop, e.g. farming:trellis or farming:beanpole.

farming.add_to_scythe_not_drops(item_name)
