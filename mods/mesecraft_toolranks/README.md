Minetest tool ranks mod

## Original mod by lisacvuk
https://github.com/lisacvuk/minetest-toolranks

Tool gains levels for digging nodes. Higher level tools take longer to
wear out.

## Are you a mod developer?
Does one of your mods add new tools?
If so, to support this mod, check if it is loaded with
```minetest.get_modpath("mesecraft_toolranks")```
and then replace all after_use definitions with mesecraft_toolranks.new_afteruse.
Optionaly, you can also replace tools description with
```mesecraft_toolranks.create_description("Tool Name", 0, 1)```
and then set original_description to your tools name.

### This is a fork
Yep, this is a simplified version of toolranks with lesser dependencies.
