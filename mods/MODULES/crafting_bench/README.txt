An auto-crafting bench. Place raw materials into its inventory, define a crafting recipe in its main grid, and then every five seconds it will generate a crafted output.

This mod is compatible with hoppers.

The crafting rate can be modified in advanced settings.

Update by AndyIII:

- Fix item loss when digging the bench
- Remove the need to use actual items for the recipe
- Support for recipes with replacements
