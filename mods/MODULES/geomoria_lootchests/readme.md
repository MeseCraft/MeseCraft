Add lootchests to Geomoria

This mod integrates Geomoria and Lootchests, providing treasure in long forgotten corridors.

Optionally, it provides a fix for broken chests left behind by Geomoria when loading a mapblock. Please note that this will replace ALL default:chest which lack an associated inventory.  Empty chests are fine (they have an inventory, just empty).

This mod was designed for MeseCraft.  If someone wants to fork it as a stand-alone mod, it should be very simple to edit item_table.lua and mod.conf

Changelog:

- 0.1 - Initial upload
- 0.2 - Cleanup and added an option to fix buggy chests
