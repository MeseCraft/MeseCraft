Add lootchests to Geomoria

This mod integrates Geomoria and Lootchests, providing treasure in long forgotten corridors.

Optionally, it provides a fix for broken chests left behind by prior versions of Geomoria. (not implemented yet)

This mod was designed for MeseCraft.  If someone wants to fork it as a stand-alone mod, it should be very simple to edit item_table.lua and mod.conf
