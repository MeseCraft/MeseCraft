# Farming Redo Mod
### by TenPlus1

https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?id=9019

Farming Redo is a simplified version of the built-in farming mod in minetest and comes with wheat, cotton, carrot, cucumber, potato and tomato to start out with which spawn throughout the map... new foods need only be planted on tilled soil so no seeds are required, original wheat and cotton will require seeds which are found inside normal and jungle grass...

This mod works by adding your new plant to the {growing=1} group and numbering the stages from _1 to as many stages as you like, but the underscore MUST be used only once in the node name to separate plant from stage number e.g.

"farming:cotton_1"      through to   "farming:cotton_8"
"farming:wheat_1"       through to   "farming:wheat_8"
"farming:cucumber_4"    through to   "farming:cucumber_4"
