saras_simple_survival mod: void_chest
=====================================
Copyright 2020 freegamers.org


Description
-------------------------------------
A chest that uses the mysterious power of the void to store your items remotely. All void chests appear to have the same inventory. Void chests can also be mined and picked up, even when they appear to have stuff in them. Lastly, as everyone gets their own void chest account, the items you see in the void chest are not the same items that other players see. This chest's properties make it nice for keeping secrets, as well as essentially almost doubling your inventory space, if you choose to carry one with you!


Recipe
-------------------------------------
if the magic_materials mod is installed:

{'default:steelblock','magic_materials:void_rune','default:steelblock'},
{'magic_materials:void_rune','default:chest_locked','magic_materials:void_rune'},
{'default:steelblock','magic_materials:void_rune','default:steelblock'}

if no magic_materials mod is present then we can just use materials from default:

{'default:steelblock','default:obsidian_block','default:steelblock'},
{'default:obsidian_block','default:chest_locked','default:obsidian_block'},
{'default:steelblock','default:obsidian_block','default:steelblock'}
