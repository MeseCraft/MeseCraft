"Cave moss is technically a form of mold, but fortunately a relatively benign "

"Floor fungus produces a thin, slick film that spreads through the cracks of "

"Floor fungus has no known uses. It can penetrate deeply into cobblestone "

"Glistening strings of silk hang from the ceilings of some of the larger "

"Glow worms prey on the insects they lure and entangle with their faux starry "

msgstr ""

#: df_mapitems\doc.lua:20
msgid ""
"Glow worms can be harvested and used as a source of light but they die when "
"exposed to light significantly brighter than themselves or when immersed in "

"The iconic stalactites and stalagmites found in caverns are composed of "

"Monolithic crystals of this size form only over extremely long periods deep "
