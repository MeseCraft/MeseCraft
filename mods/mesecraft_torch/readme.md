Real Torch by TenPlus1

This mod changes minetest torches so that they have a life of 20-30 minutes which
is configurable using the torch_min_duration and torch_max_duration settings.

- 2x coal lumps can be crafted into 12x coal powder
- coal powder and an unlit torch can be crafted into a lit torch again
- punching an unlit torch with coal powder relights it
- punching an unlit torch with flint & steel relights it
- punching an unlit torch with gunpowder explodes and relights it
- never punch a lit torch with gunpowder, ow!
- water near torches make them drop as unlit torches
- coal powder can also be used for fuel or crafted into black dye
