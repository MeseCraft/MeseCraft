README = MeseCraft uses a standardized selection of 64-colors to reduce the complexity of game texturing. Please adhere to the palette colors when making textures. This palette was produced by a color and texturing wizard, so it should be very helpful. A GIMP palette file is included in this directory. There are additional palette files for other applications available at the URL below.
