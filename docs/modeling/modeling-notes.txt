Install into Blender:
* io_scene_b3d.zip in Blender to import/export models.
* Edit --> Prefernces --> Addons --> Install
* Only export in object mode.

Steps to modelings:
1. Shape in edit mode and assign vertex groups.
2. UV editing, unwrapping.
3. Make the texture. (Gimp, import color pallette)
4. Make the armature (skeleton/bones).
5. Animate the armature.


Bones should be named same as the vertex groups.
